  :desc: "An Amarr creation with powerful capabilities, the Inferno cruise missile
    was for a long time confined solely to the Amarr armed forces, but exports began
    some years ago and the missile is now found throughout the universe.\r\n\r\nA
    modified version of the Inferno cruise. Does more damage than its predecessor,
    but the volatile nature of the warhead, and its powerful containment system, reduce
    both flight time and precision."
