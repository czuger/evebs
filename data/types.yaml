    This unit contains a large fluid router array. By establishing an alternate data route to CONCORD networks, it grants de-facto administrative control of the system it's in to its owners. The Territorial Claim Unit declares to all of New Eden that the owning alliance intends to enforce their will upon this star system. Whether other alliances respect and defer to that claim is another question entirely.

    To declare your alliance's Sovereignty over an unclaimed system, deploy the Territorial Claim Unit close to a planet and activate an Entosis Link on the TCU until your alliance has full control.

    You must be a member of a valid Capsuleer alliance to deploy and/or take control of a TCU. A maximum of one TCU may be deployed in any star system. TCUs cannot be deployed in systems under non-Capsuleer Sovereignty. TCUs cannot be deployed in Wormhole space.

    upon the module. This is a one-time process, as the nanites use themselves up
    along with the trace elements mixed into their carrier fluid.\r\n\r\nThe Repair
    Paste is generally only used for emergency on-site repairs. It is then recommended
    to have the damaged components looked at by a certified technician at first opportunity."

    defensive plating and a massive capacitor, and its vastly augmented facility for
    energy destabilization makes it a formidable adversary in any engagement.

    Frustrated with the inefficiencies involved in tracking multiple fuel types, Thukker logisticians pioneered the development of prepackaged fuel. In YC 111, after a successful trial period, they converted the Tribe's entire starbase network to use fuel blocks. Capsuleers were forced to wait for this innovation while CONCORD dithered over how to handle the transition period, but were finally granted clearance in YC 113.

    This is a block of fuel designed for Gallente control towers  and Standup service modules. Forty blocks are sufficient to run a standard large tower for one hour, while medium and small towers require twenty and ten blocks respectively over the same period.
    Standup service modules are designed to be fit to Upwell structures such as the advanced Citadel structure line. These service modules consume fuel blocks while running and are capable of using any of the four fuel block types, for maximum convenience.

    Frustrated with the inefficiencies involved in tracking multiple fuel types, Thukker logisticians pioneered the development of prepackaged fuel. In YC 111, after a successful trial period, they converted the Tribe's entire starbase network to use fuel blocks. Capsuleers were forced to wait for this innovation while CONCORD dithered over how to handle the transition period, but were finally granted clearance in YC 113.

    This is a block of fuel designed for Caldari control towers and Standup service modules. Forty blocks are sufficient to run a standard large tower for one hour, while medium and small towers require twenty and ten blocks respectively over the same period.
    Standup service modules are designed to be fit to Upwell structures such as the advanced Citadel structure line. These service modules consume fuel blocks while running and are capable of using any of the four fuel block types, for maximum convenience.

    Built to represent the last word in electronic warfare, combat recon ships have onboard facilities designed to maximize the effectiveness of electronic countermeasure modules of all kinds. Filling a role next to their class counterpart, the heavy assault cruiser, combat recon ships are the state of the art when it comes to anti-support support. They are also devastating adversaries in smaller skirmishes, possessing strong defensive capabilities in addition to their electronic superiority.

    Developer: Roden Shipyards

    Roden Shipyards is the fastest growing ship manufacturer in the Federation, thanks to an extremely aggressive R&D division and extensive connections in government and military procurement communities. Roden ships are distinguished by strong armor defenses and excellent electronic capabilities. They also tend towards gunboats with exceptional range and tracking systems, and less reliance on drones than the average Federation warship.

    Built with special tracking support arrays, the Scimitar was designed in large part to assist heavy combat vessels in tracking fast-moving targets. Relatively nimble for a support cruiser, it can often be found ducking between battleships, protecting its own back while lending the behemoths the support they need to take out their enemies.

    Developer: Core Complexion Inc.

    Core Complexions ships are unusual in that they favor electronics and defense over the "lots of guns" approach traditionally favored by the Minmatar. Being a support cruiser, the Scimitar therefore fits ideally into their design scheme.

    The Scorch is a UV crystal designed by Carthum Conglomerate. Utilizing AI microtrackers it gives a good boost to range but has fairly low damage potential, low tracking and is of limited use against heavily armored targets. The delicate crystalline structures used in the manufacture of this advanced crystal degrade with use, eventually causing it to shatter.

    40% increased optimal range.
    25% reduced tracking speed.

    Note: This ammunition can only be used by large tech level II Pulse Lasers.

    Cartel in one of their extensive exploratory raids into uncharted territory some
    years ago. Whatever the case may be, this behemoth appeared on the scene suddenly
    and with little fanfare, and has very quickly become one of the Arch Angels' staple
    war vessels.

    Dromitus's headquarters succeeded in killing its leader, thus beheading the organization
    and scattering its remnants to the four winds. It has since been improved upon
    and upgraded, and the Firetail is now a mainstay in most Republic Fleet patrols.

    Developer: Kaalakiota

    As befits one of the largest weapons manufacturers in the known world, Kaalakiota's ships are very combat focused. Favoring the traditional Caldari combat strategy, they are designed around a substantial number of weapons systems, especially missile launchers. However, they have rather weak armor and structure, relying more on shields for protection.

    flown by the legendary Admiral Yakia Tovil-Toba directly into Gallente Prime's
    atmosphere, where it fragmented and struck several key locations on the planet.

    conversions used by today's Gas Harvesters as a promising new method for extracting
    spacebound ore. After many unsuccessful research projects and years of fruitless
    experiments however, the industry decided to return its focus to laser technology,
    which was eventually mastered to a level that has sustained the mining profession
    to this day.\r\n\r\nWhen the first interstellar Gas Clouds were discovered, they
    proved particularly challenging for industrialists to extract raw materials from.
    Many methods were tried, and although successful acquisition was always guaranteed,
    there was a need for much greater efficiency. It was not until the mining industry
    returned to long-abandoned projects that a solution was found. Since that time,
    Gas harvesting technology has slowly moved forward, giving birth to new industries
    and economies in the process. \r\n"

  :desc: "The core technology employed by Gas Harvesters dates back centuries, to
    a time when the extraction of material in space was still a growing industry.
    Originally, asteroid miners had seen the tractor beams and in-space catalytic
    conversions used by today's Gas Harvesters as a promising new method for extracting
    spacebound ore. After many unsuccessful research projects and years of fruitless
    experiments however, the industry decided to return its focus to laser technology,
    which was eventually mastered to a level that has sustained the mining profession
    to this day.\r\n\r\nWhen the first interstellar Gas Clouds were discovered, they
    proved particularly challenging for industrialists to extract raw materials from.
    Many methods were tried, and although successful acquisition was always guaranteed,
    there was a need for much greater efficiency. It was not until the mining industry
    returned to long-abandoned projects that a solution was found. Since that time,
    Gas harvesting technology has slowly moved forward, giving birth to new industries
    and economies in the process. \r\n\r\nResearch interest picked back up in Gas
    Harvesting technology when new, stable wormholes began proliferating across the
    cluster. As soon as the wormholes were discovered, so too, were the giant gas
    cloud pockets within the unknown systems they linked to. In a single day, the
    demand for Tech II Gas Cloud Harvester exploded. Research projects were hastily
    established and grants hurriedly thrown out to the most promising firms pursuing
    a redesign. It was only a few days before a breakthrough was made, and all the
    harvesting technology that had come before was quickly relegated to second place. "

    into particles of smaller size than possible before, while still maintaining their
    distinctive molecular structure. This means the vessel is able to carry vast amounts
    of ore in compressed form.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Rorqual is able to fit a capital
    tractor beam unit, capable of pulling in cargo containers from far greater distances
    and at far greater speeds than smaller beams can. It also possesses a sizeable
    drone bay, jump drive capability and the capacity to fit a clone vat bay. This
    combination of elements makes the Rorqual the ideal nexus to build deep space
    mining operations around.\r\n\r\nDue to its specialization towards industrial
    operations, its ship maintenance bay is able to accommodate only industrial ships,
    mining barges and their tech 2 variants."

    It wasn't long after the Thukkers began deploying their jump capable freighters that other corporations saw the inherent tactical value of such ships. After extended negotiations, Ishukone finally closed a deal exchanging undisclosed technical data for the core innovations underpinning the original Thukker Tribes design allowing them to rapidly bring to the market the largest jump capable freighter of them all, the Rhea, a true behemoth of the stars.

    Developer: Ishukone

    Ishukone, always striving to be ahead of the competition, have proved themselves to be one of the most adept starship designers in the State. A surprising majority of the Caldari Fleets ships of the line were created by their designers. Respected and feared by their peers Ishukone remain amongst the very top of the Caldari corporate machine.

    There is continuing speculation as to how exactly the Thukkers manage to move their vast caravans throughout space relatively undetected, but their expertise with jump drive technology became glaringly apparent when they created the Nomad. Now seeing widespread service with roving Thukker outrider detachments, the Nomad is rapidly becoming an essential part of Thukker life away from the great caravans.

    Developer: Thukker Mix

    Thukkers spend their entire lives forever wandering the infinite in their vast caravans. As such their technology is based as much upon necessity as their ingenious ability to tinker. Their ship designs therefore tend to based upon the standard empire templates but extensively modified for the Thukkers unique needs.

    but in YC111 it was made available to select capsuleer pilots as part of an outreach
    programme intended to raise awareness of the InterBus brand among the growing
    capsuleer population. It remains, however, a very rare sight among the spacelanes

  :desc: "An electronic interface designed to augment and enhance a marauder's siege
    abilities. Through a series of electromagnetic polarity field shifts, the bastion
    module diverts energy from the ship's propulsion and warp systems to lend additional
    power to its defensive capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis results in a greatly increased
    rate of defensive self-sustenance and a boost to the ship's overall damage resistances.
    It also extends the reach of all the vessel's weapon systems, allowing it to engage
    targets at farther ranges. Due to the ionic field created by the bastion module,
    most electronic warfare effects - from friend or foe both - will not affect the
    ship while in bastion mode. All weapons, including energy nosferatus and destabilizers,
    are unaffected by this field leaving the ship capacitor as one of the only vulnerable
    points to be found.\r\nAs a side effect of the ionic field created by the bastion
    module, beneficial remote repair and capacitor transfer effects are ineffective
    against the fitted ship while the module is active.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the lack
    of power to mobility subsystems means that neither standard propulsion nor warp
    travel are available to the ship, nor is it allowed to dock or jump until out
    of bastion mode.\r\n\r\nNote: Only one bastion module can be fitted to a marauder-class
    ship. The increased shield boosting and armor repairing gained from the bastion
    module is subject to a stacking penalty when used with other modules that affect
    the same attribute on the ship."

  :desc: "This was one of the first vessels the Sisters of EVE made available to capsuleers.
    It had been under development by the Sanctuary corporation, whose interest in
    exploration includes not only search & rescue operations but also a constant inquiry
    into the nature of the EVE Gate. Thanks to the Sisters' efforts and the Sanctuary's
    particular expertise, the Nestor is an agile, tenacious ship that aptly adheres
    to the mantra of both rescuers and explorers: Stay safe, stay hidden, and use
    every tool at your disposal. \r\n\r\nIt is particularly adept at venturing into
    dangerous territories, not merely in recovering whatever may be of interest but
    also in being able to safely bring it back. Its engines have alternate power sources
    that come into play should any of its cargo - for which it has plenty of room
    - cause serious interference with internal systems. Its weaponry runs best on
    renewable sources, an ideal for a ship that doesn't know how long it'll be in
    deep space. Its carapace is extremely well armored for a ship this agile, and
    covered in sensors capable of letting its crew track a myriad of different organic
    signatures. The crew itself is safely protected from any number of transmittable
    ailments from rescues and other unexpected passengers, thanks to special quarantine
    bays that are conveniently located near jettisonable openings. \r\n\r\nThe Sanctuary
    corporation poured uncountable resources into making the cloaking technology developed
    for the Stratios fit the Nestor, but were eventually forced to concede that it
    was impossible. The effort was not without benefit though, as part of their work
    focused on reducing the Nestor's mass enough that it could make its way into unexplored
    territories that might've been hazardous to bulkier vessels. This paid off by
    affording the Nestor unmatched access to wormhole space, and meant that the embedded
    miniature rescue vessel on the ship's hull could be relegated to a decommissioned
    role. With covert function off the table, the Sanctuary turned their eyes on logistics
    and now the Nestor serves as one of the best support platforms in New Eden.\r\n"

    Minmatar have had to develop ways not only to liberate large masses of their people,
    but also to sneak in and capture individuals of high strategic importance. \r\n\r\nThese
    kinds of black ops search-and-rescue missions might be executed for key people
    who were held by the enemy and possessed either special qualities the resistance
    needed, or information the Republic couldn't afford having tortured out of them.
    It's notable that these individuals might not all have been Minmatar, and that
    the resistance movement is unlikely to have restrained itself from using the same
    methods on key Amarr people they'd captured with the help of the Leopard.\r\n\r\nIt
    is an extremely fast ship, meant for quick and stealthy getaways, and while its
    origins are covered in rumors, chances are the Minmatar leaked it to the capsuleers
    in order to curry favor with them."

    but a troubled development period has stirred controversy among opposition senators.\r\n\r\nPresident
    Roden's office has issued a press statement extolling the capabilities of this
    new vessel:\r\n<i>\"In these tumultuous times we rely on the brave men and women
    of the Navy to stand firm against the enemies of our Federation. This administration
    stands with our armed forces and remains committed to providing these heroes with
    the best equipment available anywhere in the cluster. The Hecate makes use of
    the most advanced technology to provide unrivaled flexibility and firepower. Those
    who would threaten our liberty will learn to fear the strength and resolve of
    the Federation.\"</i>\r\n\r\nThe press release does not address the recent demands
    from a group of prominent doves in the Senate that the Navy procurement process
    be subjected to a public inquiry. The administration has previously defended the
    choice to pour unprecedented amounts of Federal funds into the development of
    the Hecate through a sole source contract with Roden Shipyards as the only way
    to retain technological parity with the other empires after the Federation received
    relatively light support from Capsuleers in their recent research efforts.\r\n-<i>Scope

    Roden Shipyards \r\n\r\nRoden Shipyards is the fastest growing ship manufacturer
    in the Federation, thanks to an extremely aggressive R&D division and extensive
    connections in government and military procurement communities. Roden ships are
    distinguished by strong armor defenses and excellent electronic capabilities.
    They also tend towards gunboats with exceptional range and tracking systems, and
    less reliance on drones than the average Federation warship."

    Massive boost to speed for a very short time. The thrust that boosts the ship, and the corresponding maximum velocity bonus, are limited by the mass of the ship that uses this module. The sheer amount of energy needed to power this system means that it must permanently reserve a fraction of the capacitor output just to maintain the integrity of its warp containment field, and when activated it substantially increases the ship's EM footprint.

    Penalty: Max capacitor reduced.

    While the Amarr Empire had first developed the ‘Reaper’ directed energy device, the Gallente were the first to modify the concept into a focused, static energy beam they called a ‘Lance’.  In truth, the Amarr had not entirely cracked the problem of holding this particular form of pseudo-stable energy on a single point before the Gallente came up with a method of focusing the beam reliably. The Amarr were quite taken with the solution the Federation had developed and at once produced their own electromagnetic variation codenamed ‘Holy Destiny’.

    The Caldari Navy’s weapons scientists were slightly puzzled that their Amarr allies had not created a simplified, focused version of the ‘Reaper’ before the Federation but attributed this to the legendarily methodical and cautious approach of imperial scientists. There was some truth to this, as the Amarr had simply not yet managed to hold the beam reliably on a single target point. The State managed to independently solve the problem of holding a focused beam of the pseudo-stable energy and the modifications necessary to create the ‘Iron Pike’ Kinetic Lance were soon made.

    The Gallente Federation was the first of the other empires to acquire the ‘Reaper’ directed energy beam technology developed principally by the Amarr Empire. Seeing an opportunity to modify the device into a powerful variant focused along a specific target line, the Federation’s weapon labs came up with a capital level ‘Thermal Lance’ that they dubbed the ‘Phalarica’. The Amarr were quick to see the potential and, after analyzing the focusing method used by the Gallente, quickly created their own variant of the weapon, followed swiftly by the other empires.

    The Republic Security Services were so concerned by reports of major advances in directed and focused capital energy weapons development in the other empires that they recommended a covert acquisition program to Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor. In contrast to this aggressive approach, the Sanmatar tasked the Republic Justice Department to use its considerable contacts with the Gallente Federation to overcome the hesitancy created by past tensions and border encounters between the two empires. As a result of this open policy, President Jacus Roden directed the Federation Navy to share its ‘Lance’ technology with the Republic Fleet and the ‘Geiravor’ Explosive Lance variant was quickly developed.

    Through weapons technology agreements long maintained in the mutual interests of the Caldari State and Amarr Empire, the ‘Reaper’ device created by the Amarr’s weapons scientists was soon passed on to the Caldari, for a suitable quid pro quo, and the State modified the specific energy output so as to produce their own favored kinetic effect at the impact point. In an allusion to Caldari mythology, the weapon was designated ‘Cold Wind’ for the powerful animistic spirit that was said to cut down trees and soldiers alike when it blew at its fiercest.

    Gallente Federation intelligence agencies were not slow in responding to the massive efforts of the Amarr Empire to develop capital ships and weapons fit to meet the threat of the Drifters, and any other emergent threats that might use similar weapons and battle doctrines. Consequently, the Federation Navy soon acquired the basic principles of the ‘Reaper’ beam technology and developed their own thermal energy variation. This weapon was designated ‘Guillotine’ in reference to the bladed execution weapon once used by the Gallente Federation’s homeworld precursor, the Garoun Empire.

    The Amarr Empire’s crash program of capital ship development included an intense effort to reverse-engineer recovered Drifter technology. While falling short of a full understanding of the weapons used by the inscrutable Drifters, the research did bear fruit in a new form of directed energy beam that weapons scientists began calling the ‘Reaper’. The Imperial Navy designated the device ‘Divine Harvest’ but the tag stuck to this weapon type when, inevitably, other empires acquired the basic concept and developed their own variations.

    of Empress Jamyl I while she was aboard an Avatar-class Titan in late August YC117,
    there was a period of soul-searching and close scrutiny of capital ship doctrines
    by the Imperial Navy's staff officers. It was soon realized that lack of experience
    in capital ship warfare had left fleet doctrines lagging behind the tactics of
    capsuleers fighting in the Outer Regions.\r\n\r\nFrom this realization was born
    the concept of the Force Auxiliary capital ship, a vessel dedicated to ensuring
    the survival of more combat- and command-oriented capital ships such as Carriers
    and Titans. The Apostle-class Force Auxiliary was commissioned in memory of Empress
    Jamyl I and is richly decorated in token of this dedication.\r\n"

  :desc: Reacting to the rise of capsuleer capital fleets, the Serpentis Corporation
    requested that the Angel Cartel’s naval architects design a dreadnought class
    capital ship. This was done using the Moros hull as the basis for a formidable
    mobile weapons platform. After receiving the prototype, capital ship engineers
    from the Cartel’s Guardian Angels division maximized the damage potential of the
    design. For good measure, the Guardian Angels combined this with advanced Serpentis
    stasis webification technology.

  :desc: "When new lower-mass wormhole connections began appearing across Anoikis
    in late YC116, ORE tasked the engineers at its advanced Outer Ring Development
    labs with creating a mining foreman vessel capable of passing through these gateways
    and exploiting the unspoiled riches available within. Creating such a compact
    ship while preserving much of the utility of the larger Orca and Rorqual designs
    proved a significant challenge, but the end result was a ship that had great potential
    for capsuleer mining operations in all areas of space.\r\n\r\nThe Porpoise is
    a smaller, more mobile and more affordable mining foreman platform that is perfect
    for supporting mining operations in dangerous space. It is capable of providing
    support to its allies through mining foreman bursts, remote shield boosters and
    survey scanners. The Porpoise also enjoys strong bonuses to mining drones, allowing
    it to pull in its own share of the ore in any mining operation."

    Once the most efficient mining drone money can buy, the Harvester Mining Drone failed to keep up with continued innovation in the years after its introduction. Over time this once prestigious piece of mining equipment fell into disuse.

    A revitalization project initiated in YC 118 updated the venerable Harvester designs with the latest in mining drone technology. Initially sold to empire-based mining operations across the cluster, blueprints eventually ended up in the hands of capsuleers and pirates through the usual bloody avenues.

    genius of Korako 'The Rabbit' Kosakami was quickly applied to capital ship development
    as other pirate and outlaw groups rolled out their fleets. The Caiman is a dreadnought
    that continues the Guristas emphasis on light strike capability among all their
    ships. Strong shields, together with powerful cruise missile and torpedo systems,
    round out a dreadnought that reflects the Rabbit's practice of taking Caldari
    hulls and twisting them to the preference of the Guristas.

    Ah yeah, Ninth Mega. What do I mean? Look, the Big Eight, right? They carve up
    the State between them. They get together, decide what each Mega will run, make
    it look good for the masses, bit of competition here, a bit of warfare there.
    That's all show. They're vertically integrated megacorps that run entire sectors
    of the economy because they've all signed up to a plan. Well, we're the anti-plan.

    focused on ways to improve a vessel's astrometric capabilities. The two-pronged
    solution of boosting both the strength of the launchers and the probes they deployed

    technology has brought them somewhat back into vogue. Based upon the remarkable
    flexibility fullerene-based technology, Sleeper-based scoping arrays allowed projectile
    weaponry to produce longer-ranged accuracy without reducing the weapon's rate-of-fire.
    While a resurgence of scoping arrays is not expected, this subsystem certainly
    shows its uses in modern warfare.

    what it delivered as a standalone unit was undoubtedly impressive, what would
